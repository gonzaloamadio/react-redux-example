## The proyect

There is a counter that we can update. Increment, decrement.

Initially we manage that with React state.

Then we add Redux to manage this state.

## How to use this proyect

Clone it and install packages with

```npm install```
```npm start```

Then explore each commit, see the changes and the messages in each commit, to see what concept we have learned with it.
